# About Therians
A Therian is someone who feels a deep connection to an animal. 
Otherkin refers to someone who feels a deep connection to, but not limited to, mythical creatures or aliens. 
Sort of like a Therian, but for beings that aren’t real-world animals.

# Things to know 
## [ Will be edited later ]
A Therian/Otherkin/etc wants to be left to explore who they are. If you oppress them from exploring their identity, then you're risking having a bad relationship with your child. Adults can also be Therians—it's not limited to teenagers.

A Therian/Otherkin etc is a non-human identity, which means a person who identifies as a non-human animal, either spiritually, psychologically, or both! 

Therians do NOT **BELIEVE** they are an animal (neither are furries) and they don't want to be treated *harshly* as an animal. But they *may* want to be treated *like* an animal in some ways.

I'm writing this article with guesswork and *doing my research*, which should be a top priority when dealing with a non-human identifying person. You need to ask your child/the adult what they would want (it may be an awkward conversation) and build an understanding that way.

Also, talk to them about how they feel; they need to feel cared for—unless they prefer not to talk about it, which is also okay. Again, this article is written on guesswork.

**COMMUNICATION IS KEY**  
You need to communicate with the person to better understand their feelings. Each Therian (used as an umbrella term in this context) is different. Some may want to wear a collar, some may want to be *walked*—it all depends on what the person wants, and you should be caring enough to provide for it.
