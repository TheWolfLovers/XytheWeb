# Fox 'n' Poppies

A fox.
A cave.
Some food.
Water nearby.
Safety.

All a fox needs
Is some food,
Shelter,
And a mate to keep their company.
Guard the cubs. Is all they think of.

The forest is spacious.
All the food
And water
A fox could ever ask for.
It's a lovely forest.
Nothing could ever destroy harmony.


Monsters 
With long sticks
With shiny ends 
Come through the forest 
Using magic to kill all the animals.

Monsters
In different coloured fur,
Possibly made with fellow animal skin.
Probably made by enslaving
Their own kind to farm.

Monsters
That are killing each other.
Monsters
That are destroying the fox's home.

Small rock shaped green things.
Thrown and blows up homes.
Blowing up the fox's home.
The fox has to leave his mate
And take the cubs.

The fox has to run,
Struggling to keep his precious babies.
Through the battlefield,
And through explosions,
And through his only home he ran.


The fox found a town.
It's near a different forest.
The fox goes by the roadside,
Ignoring the big scary whirring monsters.

The fox sees some more monsters.
They are young cubs.
Their fur different, but,
Their skin is also different.
They make fun of the darker skin.

They bully the darker skin.
They beat the darker skin.
They spit on the darker skin.
They leave the darker skin.
The darker skin is left alone.

The fox doesn't understand 
Why?
They are the same species.
Why?
Why are monsters like this?

First,
They were fighting each other
Second,
The cubs are fighting 
The weak.

Not even as play.
They are specifically attacking 
Their own kind.

There are more monsters
Gathering around 
Like a murder of crows.
Gathering around another monster, 
But it's the same colour as them.

This monster has fox ears
And a fox tail.
It's not real.
The monsters are throwing
Stones at the poor monster.

The fox walks passed
Heading for the forest.
The monster sees him.
The monster wants to interact.
But the fox runs.


The fox finds a new home.
In a new forest.
The cubs are safe.
But nowâ€¦
The fox is in a new world.
A world of monsters
That are everywhere
And hate each other.

What is wrong with them?
These monsters are always
Fighting.
Fighting,
Fighting,
Fighting,
Killing.

For status?
For leadership?
But why do the cubs hurt each other?

These the fox does not know.

The fox now struggles for food.
The fox now struggles for water.
The fox now has a new home.
The cubs are safe.
The fox has no more company.

The only company the fox has
Is the poppies he rests beside.

Are monsters always vile?
