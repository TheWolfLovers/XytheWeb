# About Therians
A Therian is someone who feels a deep connection to an animal, Otherkin is someone who feels a deep connection to, but not limited to, mythical creatures or aliens. Sort of like a Therian but for creatures that aren't existing animal in a way.

# Things to know 
## [ Will be edited later ]
A Therian/Otherkin/etc want to be left to explore who they are. If you oppress them from exploring their identity then you're risking having a bad relationship with your child; adults could also be a Therian, it's not limited to teenagers.

A Therian/Otherkin etc is a Non-human identity, which means a person who identifies as a non-human animal, either spiritually, psychologically, or both! 

Therians do NOT **BELIEVE** they are an animal (neither are furries) and they don't want to be treated *harshly* as an animal. But they *<u>may<u>* want to be treated as an animal. I'm writing this article with guess work and *doing my research*, which should be a top priority when dealing with a non-human person. You need to ask your child/the adult what they would want (it may be an awkward conversation) and build an understanding that way. Also, talk to them about how they feel; they need to feel cared for, unless if they don't want to talk about it that is. Again, article written on guess work.

**<u>COMMUNICATION IS KEY<u>**
You need to communicate the person's feelings
